  		Law360, New York (October 22, 2015, 1:21 PM EDT) -- Home Depot Inc. was slammed Wednesday in Texas federal court with a suit accusing the retailer of infringing a receipt handling patent that lets customers choose whether to have their receipts printed or emailed to them. 
ECeipt LLC said it registered the patent, titled "Receipt Handling Systems, Print Drivers and Methods Thereof" in February 2014 but that Home Depot is infringing the patent with its point-of-sale computer systems in its retail stores.
